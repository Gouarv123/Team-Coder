This is a codefundo project based on disaster management, which will not only predict natural disasters but also provides with suitable precautions and measures to be taken to minimise damage. Some of the most common disasters are: Earthquake, Tsunamis, Thunderstorms and floods.

What are natural disasters?

A natural event such as a flood, earthquake, or hurricane that causes great damage or loss of life. Floods, Tsunamis, Earthquake, hurricanes: these are caused due to reasons like heavy rainfall, Earthuake or volcanic eruption in Sea or ocean, Movement of tectonic plates and Speeded conical flow of air, respectively.

What is disaster management?

Disaster Management refers to how we can protect or preserve maximum number of lives and property during a natural disaster. Disaster management plans are multi-layered and are aimed to address such issues as floods, hurricanes, fires, bombings and even mass failures of utilities or the rapid spread of disease.

Our project Aim:

We will try to create a web application, which on the basis of past datas and other meteorological factors will predict the probability of occurence of natural disaster. It will have an alert system which will alert users about any close possibilty of natural disasters in their nearby areas via email or some other reliable system. It will also provide some measures and some do's/don'ts in case there is strong possibilty of occurrence of any natural calamity.

How the application will work?

It will rely on the previous datas of the areas hit by the natural disasters and on the meteorological factors which dominate the occurence of these natural calamity. Factors like amount of expected rainfall may decide the probabiltiy of floods in a certain region, but even the history of the place matters as flood prone areas are more prone to floods when subjected to heavy rainfall. However, Tsunamis can't be predicted but their path can be tracked and nearly accurate warnings can be given to the people expected to be affected.

Representation of data:

The app will display the weather conditions of the entered or selected region with the expected possibilty of occurring of different natural disaster. It will also show the datas for the natural disasters which affected the region in past. Precautions and preventive measures will also be displayed so that the people and property loss can be minimised.

Database and its use:

We will store the datas of previous occurrences of natural calamities of different regions as the database. We will provide an interactive interface for the user to get an idea of probability of floods and tsunamis at his present coordinate.
